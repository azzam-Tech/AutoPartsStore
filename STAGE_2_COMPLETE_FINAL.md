dotnet ef database update --startup-project ../AutoPartsStore.Web
```

### 2. Update Moyasar Settings (appsettings.json)
Replace these values with your actual Moyasar credentials:
```json
"Moyasar": {
  "ApiKey": "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE",
  "PublishableKey": "YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE",
  "BaseUrl": "https://api.moyasar.com/v1",
  "CallbackUrl": "https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/callback",
  "Currency": "SAR",
  "TestMode": true
}
```
