## ? What Was Verified

### 1. Credit Card Payment (with OTP) ?

**Your Question:** *"When I select bank card, it asks for card number, expiration date, and CVV. Then a verification code is sent to complete the process."*

**Answer:** ? **YES - PERFECTLY IMPLEMENTED**

**How It Works:**
```
1. User enters card details (number, name, expiry, CVC)
2. System calls Moyasar API
3. Moyasar redirects to 3D Secure page
4. OTP sent to customer's phone via SMS
5. Customer enters OTP code
6. Payment processed
7. Callback to your system
8. Order marked as paid
9. Stock reduced
? COMPLETE!
```

**Code Location:**
- `PaymentService.InitiatePaymentAsync()` - Creates payment
- `PaymentService.ProcessPaymentCallbackAsync()` - Handles OTP verification result
- Moyasar handles 3D Secure & OTP automatically

---

### 2. Apple Pay Payment (without OTP) ?

**Your Question:** *"If I use Apple Pay, it is completed directly without a verification code."*

**Answer:** ? **YES - CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED**

**How It Works:**
```
1. User clicks "Pay with Apple Pay"
2. Face ID / Touch ID prompt appears
3. User authenticates with biometrics
4. Apple Pay token generated
5. System sends token to Moyasar
6. Payment processed instantly (no OTP!)
7. Order confirmed
? INSTANT!
```

**Why No OTP:**
- Apple Pay uses **biometric authentication** (Face ID / Touch ID)
- More secure than OTP
- Faster checkout experience
- Card details never exposed

**Code Location:**
- `InitiatePaymentRequest.ApplePayToken` - Added today ?
- `PaymentService.MapPaymentMethodToSource()` - Updated today ?
